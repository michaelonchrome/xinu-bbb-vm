Shell Commands and Processes
============================

A few new shell commands has been added to Xinu. These new commands are as follow:

create   - Creates a process and set the priority to either default 20, or what the
           user specifies. The process it can create is either 
           1. A basic process that runs an infinity loop in the background
           2. A sleep process that first sleeps then runs an infinit loop in the 
              background.
           3. A wait process that waits on a signal to exit out of the process

create <pirority INT> <process_type CHAR>

Process Type :
        --sleep : Creates a process, put it to sleep, then run an infinite loop
        --wait  : Creates a process that waits on a global semaphore to exit

Example : create 10 --sleep

ps_ready - A modify version of ps to show only the processes that are ready.

Example : ps_ready

signal : Signals a global semaphore. Takes an integer argument for how many times
         to signal that semaphore.

signal <num_of_times INT>

Example : signal 3
